# My Small App

This project showcases my Sass and CSS skills while implementing a small application using React and TypeScript.

## Description

The purpose of this project is to demonstrate my ability to effectively utilize Sass and CSS to create visually appealing and responsive user interfaces. The primary focus is on styling and design implementation.

## Technologies Used

- React: I chose React as the frontend library for this project because it provides a lightweight and efficient way to build user interfaces. It allows for reusable components and promotes modular development.

- TypeScript: I decided to use TypeScript as the programming language for this project to benefit from its static typing and improved tooling. TypeScript helps catch potential bugs and provides better code organization and readability.

## File Structure

- `app.scss`: This file contains the Sass styles for the application. It showcases my CSS skills, including proper use of selectors, organizing stylesheets, and implementing responsive designs.
